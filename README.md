# diabetes-prediction-classifier

This classifier model was constructed through a
supervised learning problem using logistic regression and support
vector machines as machine learning algorithms. We used a
dataset which consists several features which have medical data
of a particular group. We had to make some changes the dataset
in order to replace some value which seemed not practical in the
real world, by more acceptable values. Accuracy of minimizing
the bad impact of wrong results. We were more attentive about
having low false negatives than low false positives.
